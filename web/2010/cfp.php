<h4>PFLDNeT 2010</h4><br>
<b>The 8th International Workshop on Protocols for Future,
Large-Scale and Diverse Network Transports (PFLDNeT)<br>

Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA
November 28-29, 2010<br>

<h5>Scope:</h5>

<p>The Internet continues to evolve along several dimensions, allowing
more and more end systems to communicate in increasingly diverse ways.
At one end of the performance spectrum, the Internet protocols provide
communication facilities for extremely-high-speed special-use
networks. At the other end of the performance spectrum, the Internet
contains very low-power and low-bandwidth networks that cater to
infrequent, bursty communication. Enabling efficient and high-
performance end-to-end communication across such a diverse
internetwork is a difficult problem, which is not solved by current
transport layer protocols.  The need to support an application base
that grows more and more dissimilar adds additional challenges.</p>

<p>The 8th International Workshop on Protocols for Future, Large-scale and
Diverse Network Transports (PFLDNeT) brings together researchers and
practitioners from all continents to exchange their ideas and
experiences in the area of transport issues for modern communication
networks. The workshop provides theorists, experimentalists and
technologists with a focused, highly interactive opportunity to
present, discuss and exchange experience on leading research,
development and future directions in transport and application
protocols for networks that are increasingly growing in size,
heterogeneity and dynamicity of interaction.</p>

<p>PFLDNeT 2010 solicits papers that further the research on end-to-end
communication protocols for todays and tomorrows Internet in all its
diversity along the continuum from specialized grid networks, optical
transports, wireless connections, to lossy and low-power networks.  A
specific focus of the workshop lies on transport protocols for the
efficient end-to-end transfer of data for a diverse set of
applications and application-layer protocols.</p>

<p>Now approaching its eighth instantiation, the PFLDneT workshop has
broadened its focus over the years from protocols targeted at specific
fast, long-distance networks (the original expansion of the PFLDneT
acronym) into a venue where all kinds of new ideas relating to
end-to-end transport protocols for diverse network scenarios are being
discussed first.</p>

<p>The previous International Workshops on Protocols for Fast, Long-
Distance Networks held at CERN (2003), Argonne (2004), Lyon (2005),
Nara (2006), Marina del Rey (2007), Manchester (2008), and Tokyo
(2009) were very successful in bringing together many researchers from
all over the world, including North America, Europe and Asia, who are
working on these problems.  PFLDNeT 2010 will continue this tradition,
and provide a perfect forum for researchers in this area to exchange
ideas and experience.</p>

<p>As in previous years, a meeting of the IRTF Internet Congestion
Control Research Group (ICCRG) will be co-located with PFLDNeT, on
November 29, 2010.</p>
