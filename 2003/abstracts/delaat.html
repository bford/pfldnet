        <p>Title: Characterization of TCP Flows over Large-Fat Networks</p>
        <p>Abstract:</p>
        
        <p>Most recent research and development in the area of high speed TCP
        has focused on the steady state behavior of TCP flows. However our
        experience with one of the first research only trans-Atlantic Lambda
        links (2.5 Gbit/s) and one of the first trans-Atlantic 10 Gbit/s Ethernet
        paths has clearly revealed the need to focus on the initial stages of
        TCP. The work we present here examines the behavior of large TCP flows
        over high bandwidth delay networks at the microscopic level. This
        inspection has led us to question whether the underlying network can
        truly support bursty protocols such as TCP at these very high speeds
        combined with such high latency. We will briefly describe the
        requirements needed to support high-speed single stream TCP in such an
        extreme network environment, without resorting to using multi-streams We
        will present experimental results from using these Trans-Atlantic links
        at iGrid2002 where we tuned various host parameters and used modified
        TCP stacks to try to improve performance over these links, and show how
        they differ with what the theoretical throughput is on these links.</p>
        
        <p>Grid applications in general can be demanding in terms of bandwidth
        requirements. A typical large-scale scientific experiment involves at
        least two parties; a data producer and a data consumer. High-energy
        physics experiments such as LHC, D0 and EDG are good examples of this.
        The data for these projects is predominantly produced at just few
        locations, the data producer, and then several researchers at diverse
        geographical locations analyze this data, the data consumers. The
        large distances that often geographically separate the researchers
        makes it difficult to have the basic access to the data in a
        reasonable timeframe. For example, EDG roughly estimates its network
        requirement at an average sustained flow of 400 Mbps for a period of
        four months out of a year. Not only does this data need to be collected,
        but additionally a large part of it needs to be transferred between
        various locations, and this has to be done over the network. Network.
        architectures are evolving to meet this new and unprecedented demand.</p>
        
        <p>We present here research into several new architectures and explore
        the scalability of protocols such as TCP to try to determine how
        applications can possibly attain the required high bandwidths needed.
        In the fall of 2001 SURFnet provided a 2.5 Gbit/s Lambda and a 10 Gbit/s
        Ethernet link between Amsterdam and Chicago for research along with
        several other research only links (DataTAG). Initial tests showed
        that increasing the speed of links and routers in the path alone was
        not sufficient to obtain an end-to-end high-speed data transfer. In
        fact the opposite was true, with this high bandwidth delay link, we
        were getting less the 10 Mbit/sec. We have since conducted extensive
        experiments on this Trans-Atlantic link both to understand how
        transport protocols behave and what additional requirements high
        speed flows, such as TCP, impose on these kinds of networks. One
        architectural shift in such high-speed networking is to minimize the
        number of routers (devices which process packets at layer 3 and
        above), and instead delegate packet forwarding to switching devices
        at layer 2 or below. Initial throughput measurements of a single TCP
        stream over such an extreme network infrastructure (i.e. the SURFnet
        Lambda) has shown surprisingly poor results. This has led us to
        study the dynamics of TCP at the microscopic level to better
        understand its behavior. The primary motivation of this work is the
        demand from HEP community to get maximum throughput over long
        distance links. Currently HEP cannot effectively use the available
        bandwidth and simply increasing network capacity does not improve
        end-to-end performance. The exclusive availability research only
        high-bandwidth delay networks and lambda’s has allowed us to
        approach problem this problem in a purely research oriented fashion.</p>
